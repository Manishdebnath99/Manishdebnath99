## 📂 Featured Projects


 📉 [**Mexico House Prices**](https://github.com/Manishdebnath99/mexico-house-price)
- 🔍 Objective: To build a regression model to accurately predict Mexico housing prices using location, surface area, and property type features.
- 🛠️ Tools: Python, PowerBI
- 🔄 Process :
  - Collected real estate data including price, location, area, and property type from Mexican housing listings.
  - Cleaned data by removing nulls, duplicates, and extreme outliers; engineered features like price_per_sqm.
  - Performed EDA using plots and correlation heatmaps to uncover key variables affecting price.
- 💡 Insights :
  - Housing prices were significantly higher in capital cities and tourist areas.
  - Surface area was positively correlated with price, but gains plateaued after a certain point.
  - Apartments had a higher price per square meter compared to standalone houses.
- ✅ Results :
  - Ridge Regression reduced prediction error with MAE ~15,200 and better generalization than Linear Regression.
  - Prepared dashboard-ready data in Power BI.
 
 📊 [**Job Posting Analysis**](https://github.com/Manishdebnath99/job-posting-analysis)  
- 🔍 Objective: To explore job trends and skills demand in the data industry.
- 🛠️ Tools: Python, SQL and Excel.
- 📊 Process:
  - Tried to collect job listings data using **web scraping and APIs**.
  - Cleaned and normalized job titles, locations, and skill tags.
  - Connected MySQL using SQL Connector for Queries.
- 💡 Insights:
  - Management, Engineering and Analyst were **top 3 demanded skills**.
  - Seoul and Apia were major hubs for **Multiple Job Post**.
  - Most Jobs were posted in **December-2021**.
  - Companies favored candidates with **real-world project exposure**.
- ✅ Result: Provided strategic recommendations for learners and job seekers.

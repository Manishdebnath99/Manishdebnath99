 📉 [**Mexico House Prices**](https://github.com/Manishdebnath99/mexico-house-price)
- 🔍 Objective: To build a regression model to accurately predict Mexico housing prices using location, surface area, and property type features.
- 🛠️ Tools: Python, PowerBI
- 🔄 Process :
- Collected real estate data including price, location, area, and property type from Mexican housing listings.
- Cleaned data by removing nulls, duplicates, and extreme outliers; engineered features like price_per_sqm.
- Performed EDA using plots and correlation heatmaps to uncover key variables affecting price.
- 💡 Insights :
- Housing prices were significantly higher in capital cities and tourist areas.
- Surface area was positively correlated with price, but gains plateaued after a certain point.
- Apartments had a higher price per square meter compared to standalone houses.
- ✅ Results :
- Ridge Regression reduced prediction error with MAE ~15,200.5 and better generalization than Linear Regression.
- Prepared dashboard-ready data in Power BI.
 
 📊 [**Job Posting Analysis**](https://github.com/Manishdebnath99/job-posting-analysis)  
- 🔍 Objective: To explore job trends and skills demand in the data industry.

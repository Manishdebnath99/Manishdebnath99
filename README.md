## 📂 Featured Projects

📊 [**Fraud Detection System**] [https://github.com/Manishdebnath99/Fraud-Detection]

- 🔍 Objective: To analyze and detect fraudulent financial transactions using machine learning, with a focus on real-time prediction, interactive visualization, and explainability.

- 🛠️ Tools: Python, Scikit-learn, Streamlit, Pandas, Seaborn, Joblib

- 🔄 Process:

    - Loaded and cleaned financial transaction data from Excel; checked missing values, types, and class imbalance.

    - Engineered features such as balance differences and flagged suspicious patterns like zero balances post-transfer.

    - Visualized fraud distribution by transaction type and time using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

    - Built a classification pipeline with Logistic Regression (class_weight='balanced'), and evaluated using confusion matrix and classification report.

    - Saved trained model with Joblib for deployment.

-💡 Insights:

   - Fraud was highly concentrated in specific transaction types with sharp balance changes.

   - Feature engineering improved model precision and interpretability.

   - Visual exploration helped uncover hidden patterns related to fraud triggers.

- ✅ Results:

   - Achieved ~94% accuracy with strong precision-recall balance for imbalanced fraud detection.

   - Deployed a Streamlit web app for real-time fraud prediction and interactive data exploration.

   - App allows users to upload new transaction data and visualize predictions instantly.


 📉 [**Mexico House Prices**](https://github.com/Manishdebnath99/mexico-house-price)
- 🔍 Objective: To build a regression model to accurately predict Mexico housing prices using location, surface area, and property type features.
- 🛠️ Tools: Python, PowerBI
- 🔄 Process :
  - Collected real estate data including price, location, area, and property type from Mexican housing listings.
  - Cleaned data by removing nulls, duplicates, and extreme outliers; engineered features like price_per_sqm.
  - Performed EDA using plots and correlation heatmaps to uncover key variables affecting price.
- 💡 Insights :
  - Housing prices were significantly higher in capital cities and tourist areas.
  - Surface area was positively correlated with price, but gains plateaued after a certain point.
  - Apartments had a higher price per square meter compared to standalone houses.
- ✅ Results :
  - Ridge Regression reduced prediction error with MAE ~15,200 and better generalization than Linear Regression.
  - Prepared dashboard-ready data in Power BI.
 
 📊 [**Job Posting Analysis**](https://github.com/Manishdebnath99/job-posting-analysis)  
- 🔍 Objective: To explore job trends and skills demand in the data industry.
- 🛠️ Tools: Python, SQL and Excel.
- 📊 Process:
  - Tried to collect job listings data using **web scraping and APIs**.
  - Cleaned and normalized job titles, locations, and skill tags.
  - Connected MySQL using SQL Connector for Queries.
- 💡 Insights:
  - Management, Engineering and Analyst were **top 3 demanded skills**.
  - Seoul and Apia were major hubs for **Multiple Job Post**.
  - Most Jobs were posted in **December-2021**.
  - Companies favored candidates with **real-world project exposure**.
- ✅ Result: Provided strategic recommendations for learners and job seekers.
